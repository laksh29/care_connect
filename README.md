# CareConnect

Our team ALPA, presents CareConnect as our submission for HackFit 2, a hackathon organized by MLH.


CareConnect is a platform that allows hospitals to share and access medical resources during a pandemic or severe accident. By registering on the platform, hospitals can input the extra resources they have available, and this information is then shared with other hospitals in the area. The platform also provides contact details for hospitals, allowing them to easily reach out and access the resources they need to save lives. CareConnect aims to connect medical institutions and improve care during crisisÂ situations.
